## Building the Project
The build process of project depends on your specific machine configuration, operating system, and other factors. In some cases, the project may not build successfully due to missing dependencies or incompatible system requirements. The project was compiled and ran on Linux, x86_64 architecture.

To build the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   https://github.com/xvectorizer/n34r357n31gh8or.git
   ```

2. Change to the `cmake-build-debug` directory (create one if it doesn't exist):

   ```
   cd n34r357n31gh8or/cmake-build-debug
   ```

3. Configure the build using CMake:

   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

   This command generates the necessary build files based on the CMakeLists.txt file in the project's root directory.

4. Build the project using Make:

   ```
   make
   ```

   This command invokes Make to compile the source code and generate the executable.

5. Run the project:
   ```
   untitled
   ```
   The executable is generated in the `cmake-build-debug` directory and the name is specified in the CMakeLists.txt file.
